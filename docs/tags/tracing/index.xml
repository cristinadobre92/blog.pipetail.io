      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I&amp;rsquo;ve published my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.pipetail.io/posts/2020-02-09-opentelemetry-introduction/&#34;&gt;introduction to the tracing with OpenTelemetry
instrumentation&lt;/a&gt;.
I was trying to explain there that tracing has some value even in standalone applications. It was just a recommendation, but today we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk about scenarios where tracing
is a must: distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have great news! OpenTelemetry will be in beta soon! What does it mean? Well, we can start instrumenting applications directly with OpenTelemetry and we can skip its ancestors.
 Ehmm. Instrumenting? Ancestors? C&amp;rsquo;mon Stepan. What does it mean?
 My bad, let me step back and make it right. OpenTelemetry is pretty new project which merges OpenCensus and OpenTracing projects together. Both projects had the same vision: make the observability of applications better with tracing.</description>
