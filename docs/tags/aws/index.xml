      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitLab-CI/CD is a great and powerful product for CI/CD pipelines. Hosted gitlab.com solution offers shared runners and some usage minutes based on your paid plan (even if the free tier). Though you might want to run your own runner in your private or public cloud. I will show how to run GitLab runner on AWS using terraform, Elastic Kubernetes Service and GitLab kubernetes integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AWS Systems Manager Session Manager: bye bye bastion hosts!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are customers where public internet access is no go. But
at the same time you need to access your EC2 instances,
right? How would you approach this? Usually, we use bastion hosts,
that&#39;s basically a different name for jump host you can use
to access internal resources. In AWS, you don&#39;t need to manage
such extra instances and take care of all the low-level configuration.
Instead, you can leverage fully managed Session Manager from the
AWS Systems Manager suite!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you using EKS managed worker
pools? If you don&#39;t have any specific reasons for not using them, you should.
It saves tons of time plus it boosts the &amp;ldquo;managed Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; feeling.
However, this pretty new offering did not cover one specific use case:
cluster with no Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
